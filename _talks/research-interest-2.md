title: "Quantum Sensing with the help of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers"
---

Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as powerful platforms for <b>quantum sensing</b> due to their exceptional sensitivity to magnetic and electric fields, temperature, and strain. My research on hybrid quantum systems, including NV centers and superconducting transmons, aligns closely with these applications. My research focuses on optimizing quantum control strategies to enhance coherence and fidelity, crucial for precise quantum measurements.

By leveraging NV centersâ€™ spin properties and their interaction with electromagnetic fields, my research contributes to developing advanced quantum sensors for nanoscale imaging and metrology. These sensors have applications in biomagnetic detection, material characterization, and quantum-enhanced sensing technologies. Additionally, my expertise in optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy plays a key role in improving NV-based quantum sensing techniques. Through my PhD aspirations, I aim to push the boundaries of quantum sensing, enabling breakthroughs in biomedical imaging, quantum magnetometry, and single-molecule detection.
