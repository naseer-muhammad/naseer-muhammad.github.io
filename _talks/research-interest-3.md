title: "Hybrid Quantum Systems and their Control"
---
My research focuses on the <b>control of hybrid quantum systems</b>, particularly those composed of Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers and superconducting circuits, including transmission line resonators and transmon qubits. This field is at the forefront of quantum technology, as such hybrid systems combine the long coherence times of NV centers with the fast, tunable interactions of superconducting circuits.

My research project involves designing optimal quantum control strategies to enhance coherence, entanglement, and information transfer between NV centers and superconducting qubits. By coupling NV centers to transmission line resonators, quantum states can be efficiently transferred, enabling robust quantum memory and quantum communication protocols. Additionally, transmon qubits provide a scalable architecture for quantum computing, where NV centers act as quantum nodes. My expertise in quantum control, simulation, and coherence optimization directly contributes to advancing hybrid quantum technologies, paving the way for applications in quantum networks, sensing, and scalable quantum computing.
