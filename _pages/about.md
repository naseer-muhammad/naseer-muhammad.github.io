About me
======

I am a passionate researcher in the Optimal Control of Hybrid Quantum Systems with a strong background in Quantum Optics and Quantum Mechanics. I recently graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Physics (CGPA: 3.68/4.00) from [Universitas Indonesia](https://www.ui.ac.id/en/) and a Bachelor's in Applied Physics from the [University of the Punjab](https://www.pu.edu.pk/). My research focuses on Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, Superconducting quantum circuits, and quantum optics. 

Currently I am looking for PhD position in the research field of optimal control of quantum systems, superconduting quantum circuits and quantum optics. I have excellent programming skills in Python (QuTiP, Qiskit), C++, and quantum computing frameworks. I won the "Best Presenter Award" at an international conference and am eager to contribute to cutting-edge quantum research.
