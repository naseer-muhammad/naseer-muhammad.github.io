About me
======

I am looking for PhD position in the research field of optimal control of quantum systems, superconduting quantum circuits and quantum optics. I have excellent programming skills in Python (QuTiP, Qiskit), C++, and quantum computing frameworks. I won the "Best Presenter Award" at an [International Physics Seminar](https://ips2024.snf-unj.ac.id/), June 2024 and I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge quantum research.

I am a passionate researcher in the Optimal Control of Hybrid Quantum Systems with a strong background in Quantum Optics and Quantum Mechanics. I recently graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Physics (CGPA: 3.68/4.00) from [Universitas Indonesia](https://www.ui.ac.id/en/) and a Bachelor's in Applied Physics from the [Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Islamabad](https://fuuastisb.edu.pk/) and Associate Bachelor's Degree with focus on Physics and Mathematics from [University of the Punjab](https://www.pu.edu.pk/). My research focuses on Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, Superconducting quantum circuits, and quantum optics. 

Currently, I am working as a Physics Lecturer at [F.G Sir Syed College, Mall Road, Saddar, Rawalpindi](https://fgssc.edu.pk/), where I teach undergraduate courses of "Quantum Mechanics" and "Electromagnetism" since August 2024 until August 2025.
