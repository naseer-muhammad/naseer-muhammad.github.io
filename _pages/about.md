About me
======

I am a passionate researcher in Quantum Physics with a strong background in Quantum Optimal Control of Hybrid Quantum Systems. I recently graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Physics (cum laude) from [Universitas Indonesia] [https://www.ui.ac.id/en/] and a Bachelor's in Applied Physics from the [University of the Punjab] [https://www.pu.edu.pk/]. My research focuses on quantum optics, superconducting transmons, and Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. I am interested in PhD positions related to quantum computing, quantum transport, and condensed matter physics. I have excellent programming skills in Python (QuTiP, Qiskit), C++, and quantum computing frameworks. I won the "Best Presenter Award" at an international conference and am eager to contribute to cutting-edge quantum research.
