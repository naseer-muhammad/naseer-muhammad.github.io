My Master’s thesis, *Quantum Optimal Control of Hybrid Quantum Systems of Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers and Superconducting Transmons*, was completed at **Universitas Indonesia** in collaboration with the **Institute of Quantum Optics, Universität Ulm (Germany)**.  

Key contributions:  
- Developed optimal control protocols to improve quantum memory fidelity.  
- Modeled interactions between **NV centers, superconducting transmons, and resonators**.  
- Combined theoretical modeling with numerical simulations using **QuTiP and Qiskit**.  

This work deepened my expertise in **quantum optics, control, and hybrid quantum architectures**.
