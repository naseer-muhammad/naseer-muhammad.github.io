This project focused on the **design and simulation of superconducting transmon qubits** in hybrid architectures.  

- Investigated coherent coupling between NV centers, transmons, and transmission line resonators.  
- Applied **quantum optimal control** to enhance fidelity and reduce decoherence.  
- Programming tools: **Python (QuTiP, Qiskit), C++**, and numerical optimization frameworks.  

This research formed a core part of my **Masterâ€™s thesis**.
