excerpt: "Studied Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond for hybrid quantum memory applications."
---

In this project, I worked on the dynamics and simulation of the state-transfer between the entangled excited states and ground states of the hybrid quantum systems using **Nitrogen-Vacancy centers** in diamond.  
- Implemented control techniques to improve memory fidelity.  
- Explored coupling with superconducting transmons.  
- Tools used: **Python (QuTiP, Qiskit), C++**.  

I presented this work at the *International Physics Seminar 2024, Jakarta*, where I received the **Best Presenter Award**.
